# Picasso 🎨

**Picasso** is an interactive drawing application that turns a simple, blank canvas into a creative space where you can paint pixel by pixel using a wide range of colors. Whether you're looking to create intricate designs or just have fun experimenting, Picasso allows you to unleash your imagination.

## 🖼️ The Journey

What began as a bootcamp project, where the user could only draw with black pixels and save or load their creations, has now evolved into a feature-rich painting tool. After completing the bootcamp, I enhanced the program with:

- **Color Variety**: Choose from a palette of colors via buttons to add life to your designs.
- **Save & Load Functionality**: Effortlessly save your artwork to a file and load it back when you return.

## 🧑‍💻 Features

- **Interactive Canvas**: Use arrow keys to move your "sprite" (pixel brush) and the spacebar to paint on the canvas.
- **Color Palette**: A dynamic color picker allows you to choose from a wide selection of colors, offering more flexibility in your artwork.
- **Save & Load**: Save your masterpiece and load it anytime for further editing or viewing.
